# Project Details

A basic project to use standalone components, services, directives, pipes and more with Angular. Currently the MVP is a "Pokemon Card" fetcher which loads Charmander on load but the user can input a number or name and get that specific Pokemon.

Phase 1 is complete. Next phases will add proper error handling, retrieving multiple pokemon, caching fetched data locally, building your own collection (favorites) of cards.

This project will evolve most likely into a "Pokedex" with styling, animations and sounds.

This project is intended to be used as a foundation for card-building and battling games.

# AngularCardsFetcher

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
